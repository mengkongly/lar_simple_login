Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

## 4 Steps to get login authentication:
1. Create new laravel project
2. Configure db connection in .env file
3. php artisan migrate        ( It will automatic generate user table, password_reset and migration table to db)
4. php artisan make:auth      ( it will automatic generate views, controller, middleware for us)
